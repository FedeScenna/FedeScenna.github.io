<p>The next block will compute word frequencies and generate the wordcloud chart:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="a-case-against-wordclouds_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>Granted, aesthetically wordclouds do not look bad. However, regarding insights, there are some items that are missing. For example, which word appears the most? “people” or “hand”? Ranking perspective is surely missing in these kind of charts. Also, words which are longer drag more attention to the reader than short words. These are the things that I find as the biggest disadvantages.</p>
<p>These issues can be solved with a barchart:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="a-case-against-wordclouds_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>With a barchart we have a clearer view of the word frequencies. We get a sense of ranking and each word gets the attention it deserves regarding its frequency.</p>
